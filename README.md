## Python Project for Data Science


For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks.

Skills Network Labs provide a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses. On the other hand, Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, offers a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy projects
